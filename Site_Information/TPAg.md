1.	Site initiated and Fluxes started on 29th June 2020. 

2.	There is no mid-canopy IRGA or CO2 measurements at TPAg sites. Mid-canopy CO2 is used to calculate CO2 storage below EC sensors, which can be large during calm condition and at night. At this site, it is not needed due to only 5m height of EC sensors. We will use Li-7500 measured one point CO2 to estimate CO2 storage below EC sensors (i.e Z x delCO2/Del time). It will be good enough.

3.	EC sensor height for CAT3 is 4.96m for wind related calculations and 4.94 for CO2 storage term. We are ok to use 5m height for all calculations. Ground is not leveled in agriculture field and 25-30 cm different does not matter. Therefore perhaps better to use 5m height in all calculations. 

4.	Elevation is approx. 175m. At TP39 and TP74 elevation on 184m. We do not have much decline in elevation in in Agric field which is on southwest side. Elevation is cross checked with Nur’s drone data that measures elevation with plus minus 10m difference. ~175m is form his drone data.  We will sample it with GPS and cell phone at tower location. 175m should be very close. There is very sharp decline on south side of the Front Road.    

5.	Two soil temperature sensors are installed at Tsoil sensors at 5cm and 10 cm depths  (model 107, CSI). We have ordered two more. They will come any day.

6.	One Soil Moisture sensor is at 5cm depth (horizontal installed) and the other is installed vertically (model CS616, CSI). The vertical sensor is buried with the top of sensor just below the soil surface. The white plastic head of sensor is 8.5 cm long, and the probe rods are 30 cm long. Therefore we measuring soil moisture in soil column of soil depth from 10 cm to 40 cm. So from the surface total 0-40 cm soil column is covered with mean soil moisture depths of 5 cm and 25 cm (10+(40-10)/2) = 25cm).

7.	Canopy height. Site started on 29 June 2020, while corn was already planted and about 0.30m tall. It was 3m tall by 20 July 2020 as per Keegan’s observations. Therefore it took about 5 week to achieve full height. If there is any change in roughness length then it will be during this 5 week period. Height increase was 0.6m per week to achieve full 3.0 m height  

8.	Soil heat flux sensor (HFT3, CSI) installed at 10cm. It will be moved to 3 cm when additional Ts sensors will be installed. 

9.	Heights of Ta/RH and Radiations sensors are same as used for VDT below canopy flux measurements.
