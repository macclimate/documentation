1. Maintaining the sapflow sensors
	Each spring:
	- Re-install sensors so signal strength is similar between years
	- Test sensors in trees to ensure they are functioning
	- Measure sapflow tree height and DBH. Input DBH in param 			spreadsheet, and use allometric equations in Peichl (2005) to 			attain sapwood area.

2. Calculating the sapflow using parameters
	
	At TP39, many sensors were removed since the total of 25 		existed, and some have stopped working (see "TPFS sapflow measurements 2014" excel sheet). Sensors 1 and 5 were tagged with the opposite number, and this was corrected in the param file.

	At TP74, DBH measurements for sensors 1-9 and 15 matched the parameters in the data computer for 2011-2013, however the rest did not and should not be used for those three years. In 2014 and 2015, this site was re-fitted with tags that matched the tree numbers (this was not previously the case) so that DBH can accurately and consistently be updated.
